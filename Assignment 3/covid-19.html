            <h1>How It Started?   </h1>     
                <p>
                   &bull; Experts say SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats. That’s also how the coronaviruses behind Middle East  respiratory syndrome &(MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) got started.
                    <br>
                    &bull; SARS-CoV-2 made the jump to humans at one of Wuhan’s open-air “wet markets.” They’re where customers buy fresh meat and fish, including animals that are killed on the spot.
                    <br>
                    &bull;Some wet markets sell wild or banned species like cobras, wild boars, and raccoon dogs. Crowded conditions can let viruses from different animals swap genes. Sometimes the virus changes so much it can start to infect and spread among people.
                    <br>
                    &bull;Still, the Wuhan market didn’t sell bats at the time of the outbreak. That’s why early suspicion also fell on pangolins, also called scaly anteaters, which are sold illegally in some markets in China. Some coronaviruses that infect pangolins are similar to SARS-CoV-2.
                    <br>
                    &bull;As SARS-CoV-2 spread both inside and outside China, it infected people who have had no direct contact with animals. That meant the virus is transmitted from one human to another. It’s now spreading in the U.S. and around the globe, meaning that people are unwittingly catching and passing on the coronavirus. This growing worldwide transmission is what is now a pandemic

            <h1>Tips for prevention   </h1>  
            <br>   
                <p>
                    <h3>1. Wash your hands frequently and carefully</h3>
                    Use warm water and soap and rub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Work the lather to your wrists, between your fingers, and under your fingernails. You can also use an antibacterial and antiviral soap.

                    Use hand sanitizer when you cannot wash your hands properly. Rewash your hands several times a day, especially after touching anything, including your phone or laptop.
                    <br> <br>
                  
                   <h3>2. Avoid touching your face</h3>
                  
                   SARS-CoV-2 can live on some surfaces for up to 72 hours. You can get the virus on your hands if you touch a surface like:

gas pump handle
your cell phone
a doorknob
Avoid touching any part of your face or head, including your mouth, nose, and eyes. Also avoid biting your fingernails. This can give SARS-CoV-2 a chance to go from your hands into your body.
<h3>3. Stop shaking hands and hugging people — for now</h3>
Similarly, avoid touching other people. Skin-to-skin contact can transmit SARS-CoV-2 from one person to another.
<br> <br>
          
<h3>4. Don’t share personal items</h3>  
Do not share personal items like:

phones
makeup
combs
It’s also important not to share eating utensils and straws. Teach children to recognize their reusable cup, straw, and other dishes for their own use only.
<br> <br>
         
<h3>5. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough and sneeze</h3>
SARS-CoV-2 is found in high amounts in the nose and mouth. This means it can be carried by air droplets to other people when you cough, sneeze, or talk. It can also land on hard surfaces and stay there for up to 3 days.

Use a tissue or sneeze into your elbow to keep your hands as clean as possible. Wash your hands carefully after you sneeze or cough, regardless
